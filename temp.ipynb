      "During the misty morning in Kyoto, the lanterns were flickering as the locals were preparing for the annual festival, filling the air with the scent of fresh mochi & incense. The drone would fly silently above the forest while analyzing wildlife movement and transmitting real time data to researchers. I hope this email finds you well. This is with regards to the internship opening at Emitrr for the AI intern role. Please find my attached resume below. Thank you. Noted, and thank you very much for considering. Looking forward to this internship and I will try my best to perform in the best way possible. I have attached the mentioned documents below. Please let me know if these are not sufficient or if anything else is required. Thank you. I have a flight on the 7th, 23rd and 24th of June as well. And I have a wedding to attend overseas on the 22nd of June (which is the purpose of my trip). So I'm afraid I will have to take these days off. Since you have allowed some flexibility during August, will it be possible to take a week off, 18th to 25th August precisely, as it will be exam week? I can definitely work for a week after August to compensate for that. I have a flight to catch on the 2nd of May (which is the first Monday in June), and I will reach the destination on the evening of the same day. Therefore, will it be possible to push the starting date any day further? Can I have more specific details on the work timings? What is the exact starting/ending time each day? You have mentioned Indian time, so I'm assuming it's 9 AM to 5 PM IST, but you have also mentioned the overall with UK time, so I'm a little bit confused there and would love to have some clarity. Just to clarify regarding the stipend of 20,000 INR, is it per month or for the entire internship? My goal is to work for 3 months (June, July & August), but once my university classes begin and provided that I will be having these classes from 9 AM to 6 PM IST (with breaks in between), will it be possible for the work timings to be flexible in a way where I can work part-time? 6 PM to 11 PM IST for example can work for me. Based on our academic calendar, our classes begin on the 22nd of July. I can be flexible with my timings as well as our university has a no-attendance criteria for high GPA achievers. Therefore, skipping classes won't be a huge problem for me (however, an ideal case would be to not skip them of course). I am genuinely happy for you and your team considering me so far by conducting the interviews and providing the tasks. Moreover, apart from the primary work based discussions that took place, I also enjoyed the casual talks. I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to you concerning the internship opportunity at Amygda Labs for the Junior AI Engineering Intern role. I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at Vellore Institute of Technology, Andhra Pradesh, India. I also work part-time as a Python tutor at Cybeorg Pvt. Ltd. Moreover, I am the co-lead of the deep learning team of the machine learning club at our university, where I’m leading a research team where we are focusing on improving optimization methods for machine learning applications, specifically for neural networks. Concerning the job role itself, I do have a good amount of experience working with LLM applications, specifically Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and Agents. Also, I would say quite confidently that I have a firm ground on the fundamentals of machine learning, deep learning and NLP, which allows me to build these applications with a fair amount of intuition. Moreover, I have worked on quite a few applications that revolve around NLP. A recent work was building a classifier to predict whether a given text is AI-generated or human written, where I had to fine tune a distilled version of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) model from Hugging Face. I also have experience building Streamlit applications. To speak about my works that involve LLMs in more detail, my first project was what I call ‘Document-Query Response Engine’, which basically is a system that takes in two inputs, a document and a user query. It is essentially a RAG application that answers these queries with the help of smart retrieval techniques such as finding the most similar chunks of texts from the document based on the query. Another project that I have worked on was during a hackathon where I built a multi-agentic system with which the user can converse using voice. Each question is essentially converted to text, which is then passed into the specified agent. There are a total of 5 agents amongst which 2 of them for example are; a web agent that retrieves information from the web, and one is a memory agent which remembers previous conversations and retrieves necessary information from the stored memory, when asked. My most recent project involving LLMs was a system that I made which aims to bridge the gap between completely autonomous recruitment systems (Applicant Tracking Systems) and pure manual ways of hiring talents. The system essentially contains 4 functions, 3 out of which incorporate LLMs. One of these functions for example goes through the provided resume and job description and returns a similarity score between the 2 documents. This was a function that I built by myself. Next the LLM is activated and it reads the resume, job description, the score, and then comments on whether the candidate is fit for the role or not. Another function of this system is a security screening function which includes scraping publicly available information of the user (GitHub, Publications, etc.) from the web in order to verify the authenticity of the information provided by the candidate in their Resume. All these projects can be viewed from my Resume where I have provided links to video demonstrations of these projects. I have attached my Resume with this email and following are links to my professional profiles: Happy to see your response and thank you very much for considering. The answers to your questions are as follows: Currently we are reaching the end of our 2nd semester which will end exactly on the 31st of this month. Following that, we have a 1 month and 3-week vacation (1st June to 21st July). One motive for me to apply for this internship was exactly this. Plus, I’m aware that the internship duration is a minimum of 3 months. After the vacation, I will be able to manage 1 to 2 months during the start of my 3rd semester without much issue. So that is 2 months of the vacation and 1 to 2 months after the vacation. I should mention that apart from university work, I do spend time working on my own projects and research, so I’m quite used to juggling things with university. I’m aware of the weaknesses of classical RAG systems (or vanilla RAG, as mentioned in your blog). While I don’t have practical experience working with knowledge graphs and multi-modal RAGs, I would 100% love to learn more about it and build systems around this. I should mention that I am still in the process of learning. In fact, this internship opportunity, if acquired, will be a game changer for me to upskill myself with regards to building such applications. Therefore, I can assure you that I can get on board with these concepts as fast as possible. There are two parts to this question, correct? One is regarding the math behind LLMs/ML and the other is regarding expertise in dealing with time series data. Math behind LLM/ML – I will 100% confidently say that when I take my time to sit and study AI, I completely go deep into understanding the underlying workings of these models, which at the crux is mathematics. But to be frank with you, my speed with understanding them is a little slow, mostly because I take a good amount of time to understand the working principles in-depth. I can numerically write the operations that take place in an artificial neural network (ANN) on paper (including backpropagation). But as the complexity increases (RNN, LSTMs, Transformers, etc.), my ability to do them on paper reduces. This is of course due to the rise in complexity and also due to the fact that I haven’t really taken my time to sit down and perform the underlying math behind complex models and architectures, let’s say for example, the attention mechanisms, on paper. The reason for this is simply because I only started diving deep into the math and workings of machine learning and deep learning about a year ago. So, I’m still a student and constantly learning. Time series – Fun fact, I just completed an assignment today that was given by our faculty on the subject ‘Time Series Analysis & Forecasting’, where one of the tasks was to fit an auto regressive (AR) model and make predictions. So yes, we are actively learning about this as a full course and I can confidently say that I do have some understanding and experience with it, at least at a fundamental level. I hope these answer your questions. Thank you very much for taking your time. Yes, I do want to work on the provided task. I plan to start working on the task tomorrow at 6:00 AM IST (1:30 AM in UK time), as my schedule today is slightly hectic. I would like to fully utilize the maximum time limit of 8 hours, so I plan to complete the work by 2:00 PM IST (9:30 AM in UK time). Hope this is ok. I recently bought a perfume from XLNC perfumery and it’s amazing. I would like to buy another one and I did get a gift of 25% off on the next purchase and the condition was to comment on Instagram and leave a review on Google. I did message the number provided in the card with screenshots of the instagram comment and google review, but they are not responding. Please look into the issue. If possible, can you provide me with the discount code here itself, I'll attach the screenshots belo Thank you for your response. I agree with what you have said but it would be nice if I can get some information from the organization itself with regards to whether there will be a delay or that the selection process is still going on. It is not nice to take the assignment and not give any sort of feedback. If possible, I urge you to to request the company to give me some feedback with regards to it as I am getting offers from other companies as well and have to decide on one. I am not sure if this is some sort of business trick. An e-mail with a heading that states 'You're Shortlisted!', immediately gives the impression that the person got hired for a job, just to later realize that the company is just asking for money through training programs in the name of 'Internship'. The word Internship used to have a very good meaning: 'The position of a student or trainee who works in an organization, in order to gain work experience.' Now whenever we see the word 'Internship', it just translates in our heads as 'Scam'. Our faculties and seniors have warned us about these business tricks that greedy companies are pulling. Moreover, you must realize that a lot of us are not fools to believe that we can get shortlisted without any formal interview, especially in this economy and in the midst of all this competition. But sadly, some people get fooled by your cheap tactics. I urge you to rephrase these types of emails and job descriptions appropriately. Placing the word 'Internship' in place of 'Training/Certification Program' or 'Training Course' is misleading. My name is Mohammed Asif Sahadh and I am a final year student currently pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science with Intelligent Systems at Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation. The purpose of this survey is to perform data collection for my Final Year Project. Hope everyone can take around 5-8 minutes to complete the questions. I would highly appreciate your response. All the data collected in this survey will remain confidential and protected to ensure the privacy of all respondents. This survey is only for research purposes and will not put anyone in any risk by participating. You can withdraw from this survey if you wish to do so. Furthermore, this survey is open for respondents that are aged 18 and above. Project Title - Predicting Personality from Social Media Content (Instagram/Facebook Post Captions, Tweets, WhatsApp About, etc.) for Job Hiring Purposes. Background/Problem - Mainstream job hiring processes are slowly losing its potential in choosing the right  candidate. Job interviews tend to be misleading as candidates can simply fake their behaiviour during the process. This leads to them not being themselves which also can be due to the fear and anxiety candidates may feel before and during the interview. Resume padding is another mainstream issue where candidates add false or exaggerated information about themselves in their resume in order to increase their chances for getting the job. Studies have shown that 72% of candidates exaggerate information on their resumes, 61% of the candidates to not add certain information and 31% of the candidates add information that are fabricated. Proposed System - This projects aims to deliver a system that predicts an individual’s personality traits, skills, and characteristics in order to enhance job-hiring processes, reduce risks that occur due to resume fraud and better understand the candidates personality and skills that apply for the job. Machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be used in order to predict the personality traits and characteristics of the individual using text data from their social media pages. The system software will be primarily used by the human resource department in an organization. Parking issues are to be marked one of the topmost problems people face when travelling through road. The main issue is difficulty in finding parking spots. Drivers need to spend a lot of time moving around in order to find a spot to park their car. This might be frustrating especially when the driver is in an emergency. This might to lead to issues like rise in congestion, time wastegate, traffic flow disruption, overcrowded footpaths, rise in criminal activities due to weak surveillance and even life threats. ParkArena is a mobile application that allows drivers to know where free parking spots are available. An area where 25 cars can be parked will be reserved for park arena users. This area will be established at every 5 kilometers distance. So within a road of 20 kilometers distance, there will be 4 park arenas reserved for park arena app users to park their cars. Each park arena will have 25 parking lots, P1 to P25. The driver who parks in the arena will have to update information like the parking lot number and the estimated time the driver will use the parking lot in the app. This information will be seen by any park arena app user the moment the driver enters the park arena. The purpose of this survey is to measure the acceptability for implementing this application. This questionnaire will take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. Hirewise is a multi-stage smart recruitment system built using NLP techniques, LLMs, and information retrieval techniques for resume–JD analysis, recruiter chat assistance, and AI-generated text detection. Developed in Streamlit with integrated authenticity checks and real-time candidate verification via web scraping. Trained a novel AI-text detector achieving 97% accuracy & F1-score, and an AUROC of 0.99, surpassing existing models like DetectGPT (0.95). So, I’m at Kerala right now, my birthplace. We have a short number of holidays and I decided to not spend it back there, as there is nothing much to do. I guess that is not the real reason. Maybe it’s because I don’t want to feel alone there, since about 90% of the student will also leave for their home town during these holidays. Moreover, I have very few people that I know back there, since the only people I primarily know are my classmates. From what I know, only Ganesh from our class is staying back on campus. However, I ever so slightly regret coming here as I could’ve done some work. It’s high time right now and it’s about time I keep developing my skills and get a good job as soon as possible. No idea how tough and frustrating this will be. Opening the job application portal in LinkedIn gives me PTSD. For 10 months after bachelor’s, I did not get a single proper interview. Well, maybe one. Anyhow, past is past. Need to focus on what’s next. So as of now, I’m a little bit disappointed. I was working on this chess move prediction model using a transformer, which I built from scratch with the help of this lecture series posted by Vizuara on building LLMs from scratch. I completed the course and then thought of creating something with that knowledge. So, I decided to engineer two things: a chess move predictor and a text personalizer. The latter is basically a model that takes in AI generated text and gives out text that sounds more like how I would write it myself. You see the problem with LLMs is that it generates this quite sophisticated English, and sometimes, few of the vocabulary it gives out is not at all something that I use. Imagine I send an LLM generated email to my supervisor, who know very well how I speak English, and he sees the word ‘flabbergasted’! I almost never use that word. On the other hand, I’m sometimes lazy to write emails. So, I prompt an LLM. What I do next is correct the things that was generated to sound more like me. And then I sent it. Now, if I fine tune this model which has weights taken from GPT-2 medium, then why not fine tune it to solve this issue. However, there is one challenge: fine tuning requires data. For this specific use case, the data will be AI generated text as the input and my personalized version as the output. I aim to collect at least 500 samples but if that is not good enough, I’ll have to keep typing stories like what I ‘m doing right now. Yes, I’m in the process of data curation as I type. Isn’t it crazy. I got around 64 samples yesterday scrolling through my old emails and google forms from by bachelor’s. But that’s obviously not enough. So, my plan is to write random stuff every now and then and feed it into ChatGPT to generate it’s AI version. This will be fed into a JSON, which will later be used for fine tuning the LLM. Now the reason I’m disappointed, the chess move predictor does not work as I expected. I will probably type a lot of stuff and hey, this might also be a good opportunity to improve my typing speed. Well, that requires not looking at the keyboard and I do occasionally look at it. Most of the time to be honest. I do think I type fast but definitely not fast enough. I think my best is 80 WPM. It’s about time I speed this up as well, since I spend most of my time in front of the computer, it will be very efficient if I learn to type faster. Ok few more words to go and I’m running out of topics. Let me give a small introduction about myself. So, my name is Mohammed Asif Sahadh and I desperately want to get married. However, I’m currently jobless and all this struggle that I’m taking in terms of improving my skills, waking up early and spending one to two hours working on DSA and aptitude problems, etc., is only so that I can get a good employment opportunity and get married soon. Yesterday, me & a cousin of mine went to few places for shopping. I went to decathlon for purchasing a cap and he had to go to the market for purchasing paint for his house. So, I will now talk about my college crush. Her name is Likitha and she is 2 years younger than me. When I first came to campus, the initial reason as to why I noticed her was because she was the tallest in class. In fact, at first, I thought she was taller than me. I did not really care much about her, just like the rest. I was there to study data science and get a good job. That was my core intention. Before arriving at Andhra Pradesh, I had set my mind to not even make friends with anyone, whether it be my roommate or classmate or anyone. I did want to be close with the faculties however, as towards the end, they might be helpful for me to secure some sort of employment. Ok right now, I’m so much more motivated to get a job. I don’t want to ask money from my father again. No, this is not some sort of revenge (there is no real reason to have anything against him anyway). He has taken real good care of me and did whatever is possible within his capacity to give me what’s best, according to him at least. The reason is just to be independent, to start my own family, and to ultimately do what pleases my creator to the best of my ability. Wow, I got side tracked. About Likitha, she is one pretty tall lady that is in my class. Fast forward to first semester itself where we had to give a presentation of a specific data science concept, she was in my team. She approached me and asked regarding it as to what exactly has to be presented, when is the date of presentation, and other details. I kept my cool and responded professionally. From that day onwards every now and then she would approach me to ask about the presentation. It was a little disturbing as I almost never free-mix back then (not now I do now, but matters certainly have gone worse). I would reciprocate her questions with a professional response. Sooner, she realized that I am a somewhat calm and helpful guy. She started asking me more questions and doubts regarding other matters. She would text me right around any of our exam seasons with regards to sharing the important topics and materials. All this was happening but I did not really care, but part of me liked it. Our first semester results were out few weeks after the commencement of out second semester. I achieved an unbelievable 9.59. It was so shocking that I started to weep, seeking forgiveness from Allah for my sins. A week after, I saw her and that was the first time I approached her first, which was a mistake. Until then, she used to approach me, but this time, my temptations took over. I made an excuse to myself that I just want to know her CGPA and if she ahs failed any subjects. This was also because she has asked for a good amount of help prior. So, I felt I should ask. So, I did, had some small talk, and left. The next day she approached me again, but this time, it was for small talk. I knew I made an error the other day. She went on to ask me regarding my CGPA and was curious as to why I study too much. I gave her brief answer, mentioning that I was jobless for a long time and the fear is what drives me to focus, maybe a little too much according to the average student. Every now and then, she would approach me and sometimes, rarely, I would approach her. She would laugh at even the smallest joke I make, and her pretty face would ever so slightly raise my heartbeat rate. As days were passing, I realized I like her. Even though our conversations were minimal, and even though I literally know nothing about her, I started to feel for her. She started to appear in my dreams. I even started to pray for her guidance, just so that maybe I can be with her in the future. But I never showed any sign of this in front of her. I was as unbothered as I can possibly be, most of which was acting and fear of being judged by other, since we were also being judged by our classmates. A memorable moment with her was when she stole my water bottle for 15 minutes. It was the end of our second semester and we had to give a presentation for our regression analysis course. Our faculty, Dr. Siva, is a legendary faculty, and a friend. He Is from amongst the coolest faculties that I have seen. He is only 28 years old, and outside the classroom, he is a super chill guy. Inside the class, he is a combination of strict, funny, friendly, and a great teacher. We were a group of 7, and no, this time Likitha was not in my group, and we decided to go meet him in his cabin to present. We went at around 3 o clock and only a 4 of the 7 members were present outside the cabin. I went in to greet him, just to see Likitha and her friend sitting there and chatting with sir. I simply said a hello, kept my water bottle on his desk, took the sweet that sir offered me, and went out to check if the other members arrived. After gathering all the members, I went in the cabin to realize my bottle is missing. I asked sir if he had seen it, and his response was, and I quote: “Someone from your class that likes you took your bottle”. I was feeling a little embarrassed, because I somewhat guessed that it was Likitha, but I did not ask her at first. I asked Abdul Rahman (a classmate) who was also in the cabin. But it was not him. Fast forward to while we were presenting, I asked Likitha for my bottle using hand gestures. She said she doesn’t have it. I believed her and thought to myself that I lost it. After leaving, Ayesha, one of our teammates, told me that the 2 girls and Siva sir are gossiping about me. She suggested that they have my bottle. Went in, and they started laughing. Siva sir asked me to check their bag, they started playing small games with me, and even though I was slightly annoyed, it was funny. I decided that I will leave, telling them that I don’t want the bottle. So, Siva sir smiled and told me to go, politely and jokingly of course. As soon as I turned to leave, Likitha said “Hey, you don’t want your bottle ah?” When I said no, she turned around to get the bottle from the hiding spot and handed it over to me. Siva sir said that they were just playing. I said that it’s totally fine, smiled and left. Just before leaving, me and Likitha looked at each other for a split second while I was smiling, and I left. There was only one thing throughout my entire walk back to my hostel room, that whether or not she actually likes me. It was giving me both happiness and fear. Happiness that this attractive lady has a crush on me, fear that this is not going well and that I might fall into something worse which is prohibited in Islam. Fast forward, we entered our third semester. The rumors started to rise, and now, pretty much the whole class thinks she likes me (which may be true at this point). However, only two people knew that I like her, Shrinivas (my roommate), and Adil (my friend from bachelor’s, and a brother). Three major events took place so far. Number one, we played a digital game together. Number two, she asked Aditya (a classmate) to ask me if I like her. Number three, we conversed a lot more than we usually do through text. The first one was a few months back. We are free after 11:50 AM on Wednesdays. So, one Wednesday she asked me to join for playing this game called “231” with her 2 other girlfriends. I was obviously reluctant and made the excuse that I was going to have tea with my friends. She insisted and I ended up accepting. There was a mix of guilt and joy, fear and pleasure. We played a few games, laughed a bit, and then I left immediately. This event took place the following week as well. The second incident was when Likitha and her friend asked Aditya to ask me if I like her during our Deep Leaning lab session. I was extremely shocked and slightly annoyed at him for entertaining such conversations. Post lab, he asked me to say “Yes or No” in front of her. I pretended like I didn’t what he is talking about. The answer was obviously for the question; do I like Likitha or not. I absolutely did not want to answer it since if I do and say Yes, I will get in much bigger trouble later. We both might feel more comfortable with each other and things might go downhill. And this is not just terms of the fact that all this is prohibited, but it will also affect my studies and my career, just like how it affects others in this age that have girl problems in their life, only achieved due to getting into a relationship. Now if I say No, it’s a lie. So, I remained silent. Nothing much took place after. The third incident took place few days ago. This was completely on me as I was getting a little too comfortable with her. We went on texting for almost an hour. I have a very strong feeling that this will go downhill really bad. May Allah protect me. I’ll share about something that happened a while ago. So, I’m currently in Kerala and need to travel back to Andhra. I came here for a small vacation and my classes start tomorrow. We had booked the tickets early on as the prices were low. Moreover, we knew that as Diwali gets near, the ticket prices will get soaring high. The ticket prices for one-way flights right now are almost twice as high as compared to the two-way ticket we purchased a month back. Now, we reached the airport 5 minutes late. The result, the check-in counter closed and now I have to wait for another 10 hours. Staying at my dad’s hotel is not a good choice as Uber prices are quite high. Heading to my aunt’s place is also a bad idea as it’s far. Travelling along will take one and a half hours. Therefore, I’m waiting at the airport itself. I will be booking the ticket by 8:20 PM, hopefully if there are seats left. The counter-lady assured me that there will be. I can directly purchase the ticket now but it will cost around 7500 rupees. If I purchase post 8:20 PM, it will be 3000. I will be paying with my own money so I will have to struggle a bit and live for the remaining 45 days on campus. There won’t be any serious expenses apart from the airport-campus trips, airport-home trips, haircuts and mobile bill charges. I’m afraid I will have to ask my dad for more cash but I will try my best not to. I need to get an internship as soon as I’m done in sha Allah so that I can continue how I have been living for the past four or so months, without using my parents’ money (apart from the old flight ticket). Besides, I will also have to ask money for conference registration, which can be anywhere between 2000 and 5000 rupees. I feel like venting about my issue with not getting married. If I got an opportunity, I will get married tomorrow. Things have gotten to a point where the harm that I’m causing myself from not getting married has reached a horrible high. My belief is getting weaker, my fear of Allah is getting less, my desire to seek forgiveness is lessening, my zest to perform other acts of worship is reducing, etc. No wonder why our prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said something along the lines of marriage completing half of faith. Now the question, why not just get married then? There are three main issues with this. The first one, which is the main one, is lack of a stable income. I’m jobless basically and this means, it’s not practical to get married right away. Besides, no father is going to give their daughter to a jobless dude. And this is exactly what I’m striving towards, to get a good job so that I can provide for myself and my future wife. All the effort that I’m taking, the real answer to Likitha’s question on why I’m studying very hard, is this. Marriage. The second issue is that I have no girl in mind. In other word, I have not found anyone suitable yet. And this is an issue because it’s a little difficult to strive to my full potential when it feels like you are struggling for someone that you don’t even know. However, it is not entirely a bad thing because if I knew someone and if I knew that I can get married to that person once I’m financially capable, then it will cause massive frustration. Since it’s prohibited to communicate with stranger women without necessity, I will be frustrated and curious to know what is going on with her. So, this may not be a real issue. The third issue, well, is only an issue when I will in sha Allah be at the verge of getting married. Basically, I want my wedding to be done in a way that completely please Allah. This means no free-mixing, no cameras, no groom and bride sitting on stage for the people to come and take pictures with, etc. It will be a simple event with two occasions: the Nikah, which is when I’m officially a husband to the man’s daughter, and the other is called Walimah, where food is served to family, friends, and the needy. A quick, sweet, and healthy event. Now there are some potential problems in doing so: literally every single family member of mine will question or criticize my move. Personally, I will become weak in such situations. A cool solution to this will be to get a girl that will a 100% support my intent. On top of that, if her father and her relatives are also supporting this, then I don’t have much to worry about. For this, I might have to travel to a good Islamic area that follows the right methodology. How to find a girl there? Well, I don’t have an answer for that yet. I’ll ask Allah for help and hope for the best. I guess, that’s about it. I have no clue how to get rid of the pimples on my face right now. It’s itchy and I know for a fact that if I itch it, it will pop and end up being a horrible mess. One of the pimples is dark red, and a little big. It is filled with blood I believe. Whenever I pop it (accidentally or otherwise), blood keeps flowing out of it and it’s disgusting. So, natural language processing deals with working with data to solve problems that are based on the human language. This requires processing of human language data, which maybe of any language or dialect, to perform an array of tasks. A while ago this used to be tasks such as text classification, which involves classifying a natural language-based sentence based on its structure, meaning, context, and/or any other features involved with language. I believe this could have started of being a simple vector-based classification where similar sentences are clustered around the same location in vector space. This means we can find the sentence closest to a cluster and classify it accordingly. Today, NLP comprises of advanced techniques such as text generation, image captioning, image to text generation, and so much more. Three things have drastically led to these advancements. One, the availability of humongous amounts of data. An amount which is almost unimaginable, or maybe, not at all imaginable. Next, we have amazing compute power today. With the rise of sophisticated and powerful graphical processing units (with NVIDIA leading this NLP revolution by providing amazing GPUs), advancement sin NLP, and further, in the world of AI, has been interesting. Finally, the rise of sophisticated machine learning models developed by researchers that make use of all this data and compute power to produce value. I’ll write an email to Farheen, who is a crush that I had during my bachelor’s. I don’t think the crush was intense, but she is a really good girl. A lot better than the girls in my class. Her righteousness is what attracted me. However, she has some hints of feminism in her. Why am I saying this, because she started a women empowerment club at our campus. Anyhow, I don’t want to talk a lot about her. Moving on to the letter. Dear Farheen, assalamu’alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuhu. I hope this email finds you well. I used to be a member of the APU Muslim Association. I’ll get straight to the point. I would like to get to know you more for the purpose of marriage. This is assuming that you are not married yet.

I usually go there at around 6 AM when there are very few people around. Can I have more specific details on the payment structure?

So, I'm planning to upgrade my phone this Diwali season. The offers and discounts during that time are usually good. The sunrise at Kanyakumari where you can see the sun rise from the ocean is a spectacular sight. Can you please confirm the venue for tomorrow's event? I want to make sure I have the correct address. So, I started using a fitness tracker and it's been motivating me to walk more. I'm trying to hit 10000 steps daily. The idli at this small restaurant is so soft and fluffy.

Is it ok if we directly do a full-time job if we get one? In other words, is doing an internship the only option for the course requirement? In the case where we can directly go full time, can I have more information as to how I should show the proof of internship, since the course requirement is to do an internship? How many months should we do the internship / job and when should we complete it as per course requirements? Hope to get s response from you soon. Thank you. There is this place in Malaysia which in my opinion s from one of the calmest places in the country. The place is called Putrajaya and I would happily live in an apartment there any day. The roads are marvelous, the houses there look exquisite, the lakes, mosques, malls, everything is to my exact liking, and the best part is that the population in this state is quite low. Kuala Lumpur on the other hand, even though more advanced and civilized, is pretty crowded. Moreover, I am not a fan of most of, or maybe all of the liberalistic views pushed forward by the left. Unfortunately, the people in this city is somewhat liberal. \n"

       "\"During the misty morning in Kyoto, the lanterns were flickering as the locals were preparing for the annual festival, filling the air with the scent of fresh mochi & incense. The drone would fly silently above the forest while analyzing wildlife movement and transmitting real time data to researchers. I hope this email finds you well. This is with regards to the internship opening at Emitrr for the AI intern role. Please find my attached resume below. Thank you. Noted, and thank you very much for considering. Looking forward to this internship and I will try my best to perform in the best way possible. I have attached the mentioned documents below. Please let me know if these are not sufficient or if anything else is required. Thank you. I have a flight on the 7th, 23rd and 24th of June as well. And I have a wedding to attend overseas on the 22nd of June (which is the purpose of my trip). So I'm afraid I will have to take these days off. Since you have allowed some flexibility during August, will it be possible to take a week off, 18th to 25th August precisely, as it will be exam week? I can definitely work for a week after August to compensate for that. I have a flight to catch on the 2nd of May (which is the first Monday in June), and I will reach the destination on the evening of the same day. Therefore, will it be possible to push the starting date any day further? Can I have more specific details on the work timings? What is the exact starting/ending time each day? You have mentioned Indian time, so I'm assuming it's 9 AM to 5 PM IST, but you have also mentioned the overall with UK time, so I'm a little bit confused there and would love to have some clarity. Just to clarify regarding the stipend of 20,000 INR, is it per month or for the entire internship? My goal is to work for 3 months (June, July & August), but once my university classes begin and provided that I will be having these classes from 9 AM to 6 PM IST (with breaks in between), will it be possible for the work timings to be flexible in a way where I can work part-time? 6 PM to 11 PM IST for example can work for me. Based on our academic calendar, our classes begin on the 22nd of July. I can be flexible with my timings as well as our university has a no-attendance criteria for high GPA achievers. Therefore, skipping classes won't be a huge problem for me (however, an ideal case would be to not skip them of course). I am genuinely happy for you and your team considering me so far by conducting the interviews and providing the tasks. Moreover, apart from the primary work based discussions that took place, I also enjoyed the casual talks. I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to you concerning the internship opportunity at Amygda Labs for the Junior AI Engineering Intern role. I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at Vellore Institute of Technology, Andhra Pradesh, India. I also work part-time as a Python tutor at Cybeorg Pvt. Ltd. Moreover, I am the co-lead of the deep learning team of the machine learning club at our university, where I’m leading a research team where we are focusing on improving optimization methods for machine learning applications, specifically for neural networks. Concerning the job role itself, I do have a good amount of experience working with LLM applications, specifically Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and Agents. Also, I would say quite confidently that I have a firm ground on the fundamentals of machine learning, deep learning and NLP, which allows me to build these applications with a fair amount of intuition. Moreover, I have worked on quite a few applications that revolve around NLP. A recent work was building a classifier to predict whether a given text is AI-generated or human written, where I had to fine tune a distilled version of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) model from Hugging Face. I also have experience building Streamlit applications. To speak about my works that involve LLMs in more detail, my first project was what I call ‘Document-Query Response Engine’, which basically is a system that takes in two inputs, a document and a user query. It is essentially a RAG application that answers these queries with the help of smart retrieval techniques such as finding the most similar chunks of texts from the document based on the query. Another project that I have worked on was during a hackathon where I built a multi-agentic system with which the user can converse using voice. Each question is essentially converted to text, which is then passed into the specified agent. There are a total of 5 agents amongst which 2 of them for example are; a web agent that retrieves information from the web, and one is a memory agent which remembers previous conversations and retrieves necessary information from the stored memory, when asked. My most recent project involving LLMs was a system that I made which aims to bridge the gap between completely autonomous recruitment systems (Applicant Tracking Systems) and pure manual ways of hiring talents. The system essentially contains 4 functions, 3 out of which incorporate LLMs. One of these functions for example goes through the provided resume and job description and returns a similarity score between the 2 documents. This was a function that I built by myself. Next the LLM is activated and it reads the resume, job description, the score, and then comments on whether the candidate is fit for the role or not. Another function of this system is a security screening function which includes scraping publicly available information of the user (GitHub, Publications, etc.) from the web in order to verify the authenticity of the information provided by the candidate in their Resume. All these projects can be viewed from my Resume where I have provided links to video demonstrations of these projects. I have attached my Resume with this email and following are links to my professional profiles: Happy to see your response and thank you very much for considering. The answers to your questions are as follows: Currently we are reaching the end of our 2nd semester which will end exactly on the 31st of this month. Following that, we have a 1 month and 3-week vacation (1st June to 21st July). One motive for me to apply for this internship was exactly this. Plus, I’m aware that the internship duration is a minimum of 3 months. After the vacation, I will be able to manage 1 to 2 months during the start of my 3rd semester without much issue. So that is 2 months of the vacation and 1 to 2 months after the vacation. I should mention that apart from university work, I do spend time working on my own projects and research, so I’m quite used to juggling things with university. I’m aware of the weaknesses of classical RAG systems (or vanilla RAG, as mentioned in your blog). While I don’t have practical experience working with knowledge graphs and multi-modal RAGs, I would 100% love to learn more about it and build systems around this. I should mention that I am still in the process of learning. In fact, this internship opportunity, if acquired, will be a game changer for me to upskill myself with regards to building such applications. Therefore, I can assure you that I can get on board with these concepts as fast as possible. There are two parts to this question, correct? One is regarding the math behind LLMs/ML and the other is regarding expertise in dealing with time series data. Math behind LLM/ML – I will 100% confidently say that when I take my time to sit and study AI, I completely go deep into understanding the underlying workings of these models, which at the crux is mathematics. But to be frank with you, my speed with understanding them is a little slow, mostly because I take a good amount of time to understand the working principles in-depth. I can numerically write the operations that take place in an artificial neural network (ANN) on paper (including backpropagation). But as the complexity increases (RNN, LSTMs, Transformers, etc.), my ability to do them on paper reduces. This is of course due to the rise in complexity and also due to the fact that I haven’t really taken my time to sit down and perform the underlying math behind complex models and architectures, let’s say for example, the attention mechanisms, on paper. The reason for this is simply because I only started diving deep into the math and workings of machine learning and deep learning about a year ago. So, I’m still a student and constantly learning. Time series – Fun fact, I just completed an assignment today that was given by our faculty on the subject ‘Time Series Analysis & Forecasting’, where one of the tasks was to fit an auto regressive (AR) model and make predictions. So yes, we are actively learning about this as a full course and I can confidently say that I do have some understanding and experience with it, at least at a fundamental level. I hope these answer your questions. Thank you very much for taking your time. Yes, I do want to work on the provided task. I plan to start working on the task tomorrow at 6:00 AM IST (1:30 AM in UK time), as my schedule today is slightly hectic. I would like to fully utilize the maximum time limit of 8 hours, so I plan to complete the work by 2:00 PM IST (9:30 AM in UK time). Hope this is ok. I recently bought a perfume from XLNC perfumery and it’s amazing. I would like to buy another one and I did get a gift of 25% off on the next purchase and the condition was to comment on Instagram and leave a review on Google. I did message the number provided in the card with screenshots of the instagram comment and google review, but they are not responding. Please look into the issue. If possible, can you provide me with the discount code here itself, I'll attach the screenshots belo Thank you for your response. I agree with what you have said but it would be nice if I can get some information from the organization itself with regards to whether there will be a delay or that the selection process is still going on. It is not nice to take the assignment and not give any sort of feedback. If possible, I urge you to to request the company to give me some feedback with regards to it as I am getting offers from other companies as well and have to decide on one. I am not sure if this is some sort of business trick. An e-mail with a heading that states 'You're Shortlisted!', immediately gives the impression that the person got hired for a job, just to later realize that the company is just asking for money through training programs in the name of 'Internship'. The word Internship used to have a very good meaning: 'The position of a student or trainee who works in an organization, in order to gain work experience.' Now whenever we see the word 'Internship', it just translates in our heads as 'Scam'. Our faculties and seniors have warned us about these business tricks that greedy companies are pulling. Moreover, you must realize that a lot of us are not fools to believe that we can get shortlisted without any formal interview, especially in this economy and in the midst of all this competition. But sadly, some people get fooled by your cheap tactics. I urge you to rephrase these types of emails and job descriptions appropriately. Placing the word 'Internship' in place of 'Training/Certification Program' or 'Training Course' is misleading. My name is Mohammed Asif Sahadh and I am a final year student currently pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science with Intelligent Systems at Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation. The purpose of this survey is to perform data collection for my Final Year Project. Hope everyone can take around 5-8 minutes to complete the questions. I would highly appreciate your response. All the data collected in this survey will remain confidential and protected to ensure the privacy of all respondents. This survey is only for research purposes and will not put anyone in any risk by participating. You can withdraw from this survey if you wish to do so. Furthermore, this survey is open for respondents that are aged 18 and above. Project Title - Predicting Personality from Social Media Content (Instagram/Facebook Post Captions, Tweets, WhatsApp About, etc.) for Job Hiring Purposes. Background/Problem - Mainstream job hiring processes are slowly losing its potential in choosing the right  candidate. Job interviews tend to be misleading as candidates can simply fake their behaiviour during the process. This leads to them not being themselves which also can be due to the fear and anxiety candidates may feel before and during the interview. Resume padding is another mainstream issue where candidates add false or exaggerated information about themselves in their resume in order to increase their chances for getting the job. Studies have shown that 72% of candidates exaggerate information on their resumes, 61% of the candidates to not add certain information and 31% of the candidates add information that are fabricated. Proposed System - This projects aims to deliver a system that predicts an individual’s personality traits, skills, and characteristics in order to enhance job-hiring processes, reduce risks that occur due to resume fraud and better understand the candidates personality and skills that apply for the job. Machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be used in order to predict the personality traits and characteristics of the individual using text data from their social media pages. The system software will be primarily used by the human resource department in an organization. Parking issues are to be marked one of the topmost problems people face when travelling through road. The main issue is difficulty in finding parking spots. Drivers need to spend a lot of time moving around in order to find a spot to park their car. This might be frustrating especially when the driver is in an emergency. This might to lead to issues like rise in congestion, time wastegate, traffic flow disruption, overcrowded footpaths, rise in criminal activities due to weak surveillance and even life threats. ParkArena is a mobile application that allows drivers to know where free parking spots are available. An area where 25 cars can be parked will be reserved for park arena users. This area will be established at every 5 kilometers distance. So within a road of 20 kilometers distance, there will be 4 park arenas reserved for park arena app users to park their cars. Each park arena will have 25 parking lots, P1 to P25. The driver who parks in the arena will have to update information like the parking lot number and the estimated time the driver will use the parking lot in the app. This information will be seen by any park arena app user the moment the driver enters the park arena. The purpose of this survey is to measure the acceptability for implementing this application. This questionnaire will take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. Hirewise is a multi-stage smart recruitment system built using NLP techniques, LLMs, and information retrieval techniques for resume–JD analysis, recruiter chat assistance, and AI-generated text detection. Developed in Streamlit with integrated authenticity checks and real-time candidate verification via web scraping. Trained a novel AI-text detector achieving 97% accuracy & F1-score, and an AUROC of 0.99, surpassing existing models like DetectGPT (0.95). So, I’m at Kerala right now, my birthplace. We have a short number of holidays and I decided to not spend it back there, as there is nothing much to do. I guess that is not the real reason. Maybe it’s because I don’t want to feel alone there, since about 90% of the student will also leave for their home town during these holidays. Moreover, I have very few people that I know back there, since the only people I primarily know are my classmates. From what I know, only Ganesh from our class is staying back on campus. However, I ever so slightly regret coming here as I could’ve done some work. It’s high time right now and it’s about time I keep developing my skills and get a good job as soon as possible. No idea how tough and frustrating this will be. Opening the job application portal in LinkedIn gives me PTSD. For 10 months after bachelor’s, I did not get a single proper interview. Well, maybe one. Anyhow, past is past. Need to focus on what’s next. So as of now, I’m a little bit disappointed. I was working on this chess move prediction model using a transformer, which I built from scratch with the help of this lecture series posted by Vizuara on building LLMs from scratch. I completed the course and then thought of creating something with that knowledge. So, I decided to engineer two things: a chess move predictor and a text personalizer. The latter is basically a model that takes in AI generated text and gives out text that sounds more like how I would write it myself. You see the problem with LLMs is that it generates this quite sophisticated English, and sometimes, few of the vocabulary it gives out is not at all something that I use. Imagine I send an LLM generated email to my supervisor, who know very well how I speak English, and he sees the word ‘flabbergasted’! I almost never use that word. On the other hand, I’m sometimes lazy to write emails. So, I prompt an LLM. What I do next is correct the things that was generated to sound more like me. And then I sent it. Now, if I fine tune this model which has weights taken from GPT-2 medium, then why not fine tune it to solve this issue. However, there is one challenge: fine tuning requires data. For this specific use case, the data will be AI generated text as the input and my personalized version as the output. I aim to collect at least 500 samples but if that is not good enough, I’ll have to keep typing stories like what I ‘m doing right now. Yes, I’m in the process of data curation as I type. Isn’t it crazy. I got around 64 samples yesterday scrolling through my old emails and google forms from by bachelor’s. But that’s obviously not enough. So, my plan is to write random stuff every now and then and feed it into ChatGPT to generate it’s AI version. This will be fed into a JSON, which will later be used for fine tuning the LLM. Now the reason I’m disappointed, the chess move predictor does not work as I expected. I will probably type a lot of stuff and hey, this might also be a good opportunity to improve my typing speed. Well, that requires not looking at the keyboard and I do occasionally look at it. Most of the time to be honest. I do think I type fast but definitely not fast enough. I think my best is 80 WPM. It’s about time I speed this up as well, since I spend most of my time in front of the computer, it will be very efficient if I learn to type faster. Ok few more words to go and I’m running out of topics. Let me give a small introduction about myself. So, my name is Mohammed Asif Sahadh and I desperately want to get married. However, I’m currently jobless and all this struggle that I’m taking in terms of improving my skills, waking up early and spending one to two hours working on DSA and aptitude problems, etc., is only so that I can get a good employment opportunity and get married soon. Yesterday, me & a cousin of mine went to few places for shopping. I went to decathlon for purchasing a cap and he had to go to the market for purchasing paint for his house. So, I will now talk about my college crush. Her name is Likitha and she is 2 years younger than me. When I first came to campus, the initial reason as to why I noticed her was because she was the tallest in class. In fact, at first, I thought she was taller than me. I did not really care much about her, just like the rest. I was there to study data science and get a good job. That was my core intention. Before arriving at Andhra Pradesh, I had set my mind to not even make friends with anyone, whether it be my roommate or classmate or anyone. I did want to be close with the faculties however, as towards the end, they might be helpful for me to secure some sort of employment. Ok right now, I’m so much more motivated to get a job. I don’t want to ask money from my father again. No, this is not some sort of revenge (there is no real reason to have anything against him anyway). He has taken real good care of me and did whatever is possible within his capacity to give me what’s best, according to him at least. The reason is just to be independent, to start my own family, and to ultimately do what pleases my creator to the best of my ability. Wow, I got side tracked. About Likitha, she is one pretty tall lady that is in my class. Fast forward to first semester itself where we had to give a presentation of a specific data science concept, she was in my team. She approached me and asked regarding it as to what exactly has to be presented, when is the date of presentation, and other details. I kept my cool and responded professionally. From that day onwards every now and then she would approach me to ask about the presentation. It was a little disturbing as I almost never free-mix back then (not now I do now, but matters certainly have gone worse). I would reciprocate her questions with a professional response. Sooner, she realized that I am a somewhat calm and helpful guy. She started asking me more questions and doubts regarding other matters. She would text me right around any of our exam seasons with regards to sharing the important topics and materials. All this was happening but I did not really care, but part of me liked it. Our first semester results were out few weeks after the commencement of out second semester. I achieved an unbelievable 9.59. It was so shocking that I started to weep, seeking forgiveness from Allah for my sins. A week after, I saw her and that was the first time I approached her first, which was a mistake. Until then, she used to approach me, but this time, my temptations took over. I made an excuse to myself that I just want to know her CGPA and if she ahs failed any subjects. This was also because she has asked for a good amount of help prior. So, I felt I should ask. So, I did, had some small talk, and left. The next day she approached me again, but this time, it was for small talk. I knew I made an error the other day. She went on to ask me regarding my CGPA and was curious as to why I study too much. I gave her brief answer, mentioning that I was jobless for a long time and the fear is what drives me to focus, maybe a little too much according to the average student. Every now and then, she would approach me and sometimes, rarely, I would approach her. She would laugh at even the smallest joke I make, and her pretty face would ever so slightly raise my heartbeat rate. As days were passing, I realized I like her. Even though our conversations were minimal, and even though I literally know nothing about her, I started to feel for her. She started to appear in my dreams. I even started to pray for her guidance, just so that maybe I can be with her in the future. But I never showed any sign of this in front of her. I was as unbothered as I can possibly be, most of which was acting and fear of being judged by other, since we were also being judged by our classmates. A memorable moment with her was when she stole my water bottle for 15 minutes. It was the end of our second semester and we had to give a presentation for our regression analysis course. Our faculty, Dr. Siva, is a legendary faculty, and a friend. He Is from amongst the coolest faculties that I have seen. He is only 28 years old, and outside the classroom, he is a super chill guy. Inside the class, he is a combination of strict, funny, friendly, and a great teacher. We were a group of 7, and no, this time Likitha was not in my group, and we decided to go meet him in his cabin to present. We went at around 3 o clock and only a 4 of the 7 members were present outside the cabin. I went in to greet him, just to see Likitha and her friend sitting there and chatting with sir. I simply said a hello, kept my water bottle on his desk, took the sweet that sir offered me, and went out to check if the other members arrived. After gathering all the members, I went in the cabin to realize my bottle is missing. I asked sir if he had seen it, and his response was, and I quote: “Someone from your class that likes you took your bottle”. I was feeling a little embarrassed, because I somewhat guessed that it was Likitha, but I did not ask her at first. I asked Abdul Rahman (a classmate) who was also in the cabin. But it was not him. Fast forward to while we were presenting, I asked Likitha for my bottle using hand gestures. She said she doesn’t have it. I believed her and thought to myself that I lost it. After leaving, Ayesha, one of our teammates, told me that the 2 girls and Siva sir are gossiping about me. She suggested that they have my bottle. Went in, and they started laughing. Siva sir asked me to check their bag, they started playing small games with me, and even though I was slightly annoyed, it was funny. I decided that I will leave, telling them that I don’t want the bottle. So, Siva sir smiled and told me to go, politely and jokingly of course. As soon as I turned to leave, Likitha said “Hey, you don’t want your bottle ah?” When I said no, she turned around to get the bottle from the hiding spot and handed it over to me. Siva sir said that they were just playing. I said that it’s totally fine, smiled and left. Just before leaving, me and Likitha looked at each other for a split second while I was smiling, and I left. There was only one thing throughout my entire walk back to my hostel room, that whether or not she actually likes me. It was giving me both happiness and fear. Happiness that this attractive lady has a crush on me, fear that this is not going well and that I might fall into something worse which is prohibited in Islam. Fast forward, we entered our third semester. The rumors started to rise, and now, pretty much the whole class thinks she likes me (which may be true at this point). However, only two people knew that I like her, Shrinivas (my roommate), and Adil (my friend from bachelor’s, and a brother). Three major events took place so far. Number one, we played a digital game together. Number two, she asked Aditya (a classmate) to ask me if I like her. Number three, we conversed a lot more than we usually do through text. The first one was a few months back. We are free after 11:50 AM on Wednesdays. So, one Wednesday she asked me to join for playing this game called “231” with her 2 other girlfriends. I was obviously reluctant and made the excuse that I was going to have tea with my friends. She insisted and I ended up accepting. There was a mix of guilt and joy, fear and pleasure. We played a few games, laughed a bit, and then I left immediately. This event took place the following week as well. The second incident was when Likitha and her friend asked Aditya to ask me if I like her during our Deep Leaning lab session. I was extremely shocked and slightly annoyed at him for entertaining such conversations. Post lab, he asked me to say “Yes or No” in front of her. I pretended like I didn’t what he is talking about. The answer was obviously for the question; do I like Likitha or not. I absolutely did not want to answer it since if I do and say Yes, I will get in much bigger trouble later. We both might feel more comfortable with each other and things might go downhill. And this is not just terms of the fact that all this is prohibited, but it will also affect my studies and my career, just like how it affects others in this age that have girl problems in their life, only achieved due to getting into a relationship. Now if I say No, it’s a lie. So, I remained silent. Nothing much took place after. The third incident took place few days ago. This was completely on me as I was getting a little too comfortable with her. We went on texting for almost an hour. I have a very strong feeling that this will go downhill really bad. May Allah protect me. I’ll share about something that happened a while ago. So, I’m currently in Kerala and need to travel back to Andhra. I came here for a small vacation and my classes start tomorrow. We had booked the tickets early on as the prices were low. Moreover, we knew that as Diwali gets near, the ticket prices will get soaring high. The ticket prices for one-way flights right now are almost twice as high as compared to the two-way ticket we purchased a month back. Now, we reached the airport 5 minutes late. The result, the check-in counter closed and now I have to wait for another 10 hours. Staying at my dad’s hotel is not a good choice as Uber prices are quite high. Heading to my aunt’s place is also a bad idea as it’s far. Travelling along will take one and a half hours. Therefore, I’m waiting at the airport itself. I will be booking the ticket by 8:20 PM, hopefully if there are seats left. The counter-lady assured me that there will be. I can directly purchase the ticket now but it will cost around 7500 rupees. If I purchase post 8:20 PM, it will be 3000. I will be paying with my own money so I will have to struggle a bit and live for the remaining 45 days on campus. There won’t be any serious expenses apart from the airport-campus trips, airport-home trips, haircuts and mobile bill charges. I’m afraid I will have to ask my dad for more cash but I will try my best not to. I need to get an internship as soon as I’m done in sha Allah so that I can continue how I have been living for the past four or so months, without using my parents’ money (apart from the old flight ticket). Besides, I will also have to ask money for conference registration, which can be anywhere between 2000 and 5000 rupees. I feel like venting about my issue with not getting married. If I got an opportunity, I will get married tomorrow. Things have gotten to a point where the harm that I’m causing myself from not getting married has reached a horrible high. My belief is getting weaker, my fear of Allah is getting less, my desire to seek forgiveness is lessening, my zest to perform other acts of worship is reducing, etc. No wonder why our prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said something along the lines of marriage completing half of faith. Now the question, why not just get married then? There are three main issues with this. The first one, which is the main one, is lack of a stable income. I’m jobless basically and this means, it’s not practical to get married right away. Besides, no father is going to give their daughter to a jobless dude. And this is exactly what I’m striving towards, to get a good job so that I can provide for myself and my future wife. All the effort that I’m taking, the real answer to Likitha’s question on why I’m studying very hard, is this. Marriage. The second issue is that I have no girl in mind. In other word, I have not found anyone suitable yet. And this is an issue because it’s a little difficult to strive to my full potential when it feels like you are struggling for someone that you don’t even know. However, it is not entirely a bad thing because if I knew someone and if I knew that I can get married to that person once I’m financially capable, then it will cause massive frustration. Since it’s prohibited to communicate with stranger women without necessity, I will be frustrated and curious to know what is going on with her. So, this may not be a real issue. The third issue, well, is only an issue when I will in sha Allah be at the verge of getting married. Basically, I want my wedding to be done in a way that completely please Allah. This means no free-mixing, no cameras, no groom and bride sitting on stage for the people to come and take pictures with, etc. It will be a simple event with two occasions: the Nikah, which is when I’m officially a husband to the man’s daughter, and the other is called Walimah, where food is served to family, friends, and the needy. A quick, sweet, and healthy event. Now there are some potential problems in doing so: literally every single family member of mine will question or criticize my move. Personally, I will become weak in such situations. A cool solution to this will be to get a girl that will a 100% support my intent. On top of that, if her father and her relatives are also supporting this, then I don’t have much to worry about. For this, I might have to travel to a good Islamic area that follows the right methodology. How to find a girl there? Well, I don’t have an answer for that yet. I’ll ask Allah for help and hope for the best. I guess, that’s about it. I have no clue how to get rid of the pimples on my face right now. It’s itchy and I know for a fact that if I itch it, it will pop and end up being a horrible mess. One of the pimples is dark red, and a little big. It is filled with blood I believe. Whenever I pop it (accidentally or otherwise), blood keeps flowing out of it and it’s disgusting. So, natural language processing deals with working with data to solve problems that are based on the human language. This requires processing of human language data, which maybe of any language or dialect, to perform an array of tasks. A while ago this used to be tasks such as text classification, which involves classifying a natural language-based sentence based on its structure, meaning, context, and/or any other features involved with language. I believe this could have started of being a simple vector-based classification where similar sentences are clustered around the same location in vector space. This means we can find the sentence closest to a cluster and classify it accordingly. Today, NLP comprises of advanced techniques such as text generation, image captioning, image to text generation, and so much more. Three things have drastically led to these advancements. One, the availability of humongous amounts of data. An amount which is almost unimaginable, or maybe, not at all imaginable. Next, we have amazing compute power today. With the rise of sophisticated and powerful graphical processing units (with NVIDIA leading this NLP revolution by providing amazing GPUs), advancement sin NLP, and further, in the world of AI, has been interesting. Finally, the rise of sophisticated machine learning models developed by researchers that make use of all this data and compute power to produce value. I’ll write an email to Farheen, who is a crush that I had during my bachelor’s. I don’t think the crush was intense, but she is a really good girl. A lot better than the girls in my class. Her righteousness is what attracted me. However, she has some hints of feminism in her. Why am I saying this, because she started a women empowerment club at our campus. Anyhow, I don’t want to talk a lot about her. Moving on to the letter. Dear Farheen, assalamu’alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuhu. I hope this email finds you well. I used to be a member of the APU Muslim Association. I’ll get straight to the point. I would like to get to know you more for the purpose of marriage. This is assuming that you are not married yet. If you are interested, please send me your father’s (or guardian’s) number. May Allah grant us what’s best. Mohammed Asif Sahadh. \""
